# PHP Base64 Decode Alternative
Some strict antivirus will detected the native one to prevent exploits that use that method. So we need some costume <code>base64_encode</code>

### Usage
Use <code>Your_Costum_Base64_Decode_Function</code> as you would the standard <code>base64_decode</code> function.


### License
There is no license, use by yourself, sell by yourself, costumize by yourself, risk by yourself.
